## üìù How to Contribute

Alarmio is a user-driven project. All contributors, including myself, are motivated by personal needs and ideals. We don‚Äôt have a professional support line or paid development team. Any contribution, regardless of size or format, is welcome. **If you need help or feedback, feel free to reach out.**

- **üñ•Ô∏è Development:** Help by fixing bugs, implementing features, or researching issues. Review CONTRIBUTING.md, then open a PR for review.
- **üç• Designing:** Suggestions to improve interfaces, including accessibility and usability, are welcome.
- **ü§ù Helping users:** Respond to issues and identify duplicates to reduce workload on maintainers.
- **üìÇ Filing issues:** Report bugs and edge cases with relevant info (device name, Android version, Alarmio version, description). Screen recordings and logcat info are helpful.
- **üåç Localization:** If Alarmio does not support your language, consider translating it! In-app text is in strings.xml. Copy this file to ../values-{lang}/strings.xml when translated.
- **üìÑ Documentation:** Write guides and explanations about Alarmio, its usage, and how to contribute. This can include README updates, user tutorials, or adding comments to undocumented functions.

### ‚úÖ Other ways of support

Not everyone has the time or technical knowledge to help out with many of the above - we understand that. With this in mind, here are a few other ways to help us out that don't require as much time or dedication.

- **üíà Advertising:** Spread the word! If you like what we're doing here, getting more people involved is the best way to help improve it. Suggestions include: posting on social media... writing a blog post... yeah, right, you get the idea.
- **üíµ Donations:** I've invested a lot of time into this app - as have many of its contributors. Many of us have paying jobs, difficult classes, or otherwise important life occurrences that prevent us from putting all our time into software.
- **üì¢ Politics:** Yep, you're reading this right. Free software is, in fact, a very political thing - and I'd like to think we're taking the right approach. If you can, consider supporting FOSS applications and services over proprietary ones.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Acknowledgements

I would like to give a huge thanks to all of Alarmio's [contributors](https://github.com/fennifith/Alarmio/graphs/contributors), the developers that write the software we depend on, and the users that support our goal. Also, props to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/about/) for maintaining the free software repository that distributes our app and many others like it.

I have received a lot of thanks from various people for the time I've put into this, and that thought helps me get up in the morning. If someone fixes a bug you encountered, helps you out in an issue, or implements a feature you enjoy, please consider sending them a tip or a thank-you note to let them know that you appreciate their time :)
